## 🧩 About the Game

This project is a mobile game where the player guesses a **5-letter word** using the built-in keyboard. After each guess, the game evaluates and provides feedback:

- 🟩 **Green**: Letter is in the correct position.
- 🟨 **Yellow**: Letter exists in the word but in the wrong position.
- ⬛ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.

The goal is to guess the correct word within a limited number of tries — just like the original Wordle!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Navigation** – For navigating between screens.
- **Retrofit** – To fetch the word of the day from an external API.
- **Material 3** – Modern UI components for a clean and minimal look.
